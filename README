IPL
-------------
IPL (Image Processing Library) is a collection of C routines for
digital image processing, providing algorithms for image filtering,
enhancement and segmentation, motion analysis and features detection.

IPL is developed and maintained by Andrea Gagliardi La Gala
(andrea.lagala@gmail.com).


APPLICABILITY
-------------
IPL's objective is to support research in a variety of domains and
industries, including:
  - Medical Imaging (enhancement of Gamma-Ray, X-Ray, Magnetic
    Resonances and ultrasound images, such as bone and CT scans)
  - Astronomical Imaging
  - Forensic Imaging (enhancement of fingerprints and their ridges)
  - Visual inspection of manufactured goods
  - Surveillance systems

Disclaimer: IPL is not approved or endorsed by any Organizations operating
in the industries mentioned above, not even for clinical or diagnostic usage,
and should not be relied upon for any diagnostic decisions. It is provided
'as is' and any risks associated with its misuse or lack of quality lie
completely with the user. The only purpose of IPL is to support and enhance
research in the enlisted areas.


LICENSING
-------------
IPL is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3,
which lets you freely redistribute it and/or modify it, as long as you preserve
the credit information and license your derived work under the identical terms.


EXTERNAL LIBS
-------------
IPL depends on and extends:
  - Leptonica library by Dan S. Bloomberg (http://www.leptonica.com/)

and (optionally) integrates:
  - FFTW library by Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson (http://www.fftw.org/)
  - fuzzylite C++ library by Juan Rada-Vilela (http://code.google.com/p/fuzzy-lite/)

to achieve fast and efficient image filtering and manipulation within the frequency
domain (using the Discrete Fourier Transform and its inverse) and by using Fuzzy
Logic (based on the theory of Fuzzy Sets first devised by Lotfi Zadeh).


HOW TO BUILD
-------------
IPL can be compiled by any modern C99 compiler and runs on all major UNIX-based
platforms. To build it:
  - install Leptonica 1.68 (see instructions on Leptonica web pages)
  - optionally install FFTW 3.2.2 (see instructions on FFTW web pages)
  - optionally install fuzzylite 1.03 (see instructions on fuzzylite web pages)
  - type in console:
    ./configure [--prefix install-dir]
    make
    make install
